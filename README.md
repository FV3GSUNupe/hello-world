# hello-world

I'm a developer for an insurance company that hasn't developed in a few years. So I need to re-educate myself in order to take advantage of future opportunities. Wish me luck!

Oh, and now I'm trying to learn Git! Luckily I've gone through the 'horrors' of Clearcase, RMS, Panvalet, and Subversion. So if ths is as easy and cool as the developer community says it is, then I'm golden!
